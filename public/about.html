<p>
  I am a recent graduate in Computer Science with a strong foundation in programming and software development. During my studies, I honed my skills in languages like Java, C++, C, and Python, alongside web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django. <br>
My major project involved creating a job portal website, where I implemented features for job seekers, employers, and administrators using Django and SQLite.

 <p>Beyond academics, Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience through an internship with Future Skills Expert, coordinated college events, and actively participated in hackathons. My passion for problem-solving extends to learning new algorithms and techniques,
  especially in the realm of Data Structures and Machine Learning.

          I am also expanding my skillset in SQL and cloud technologies like AWS, aiming to contribute to challenging software solutions in my future roles.
